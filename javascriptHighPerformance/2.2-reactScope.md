# Block scope
Variables declared inside a `{ }` block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
`let` and `const` These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
{

}

# Function scope
Each function creates a new scope.Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Variables declared with `var`, `let` and `const` are quite similar when declared inside a function.

function(){

}

# Global scope
A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab).
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.

function abc(){ 
    l3 = 'orange'
}
abc()
console.log(l3)
