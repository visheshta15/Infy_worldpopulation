Scope of a Variable: The word scope means the extent to which we can use something. In programming variable scope means the extent to which we can use a variable within a program.

# In JavaScript there are mainly 3 types of scopes:

# Local scope 
Local variables are defined by the functions. Variables having a local scope restricts their usage to the function in which they are defined.
It’s also known as Default Scope.

# Global scope
When you’re in the global scope `var something` of a browser will define a global variable because the global scope is the highest scope in browsers where it is not the same case in Node. Inside a Node module, a variable will be limited to that module only; and global scope will not be the top scope anymore

# Script scope
The Script scope is actually a place to keep the variables that are shared and strictly not exposed to the Global scope. Each child in a script or script module shares the Script scope
